# Stocks Data Analysis
This project contains visualizations that were built using Tableau Desktop (https://www.tableau.com/products/desktop) for comparing financial performance of different companies and industries. Based on Stephen Few and Edward Tufte guidelines, pros and cons of each visualization are discussed in description files.


## Visualizations

Description files corresponding to each type of visualization can be found here:

1. Viusalizations based on Analytical Questions (https://github.com/muneeb706/information-visualization/blob/master/Description-of-visualizations-based-on-analytical-questions.pdf)
1. Viusalizations based on Attributes (https://github.com/muneeb706/information-visualization/blob/master/Description-of-visualization-based-on-attributes.pdf)


## How To
To see the visualizations separately, you need to install Tableau Desktop.

After installing it open concerned Tableau Packaged Workbook (.twbx) file using Tableau Desktop.
